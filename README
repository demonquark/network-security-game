== What is this?

Network Attack and Defence Game using Pareto Optimization and Q-learning

== That sound complicated.

It isn't. Why else would it fit in less than 10 files?

== Why should I care about it?

You shouldn't. 
I'm running an experiment and needed a place to keep track of my code. That's pretty much the only reason this is on github. :/
If you want, you can peruse the code, but let's be honest ... You won't.

== Can I use it?

Sure. If you think it's useful, use it. Just don't claim that you wrote it though. Cause, you know... You didn't. :)
